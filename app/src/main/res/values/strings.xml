        <big>Welcome to Memory Game!</big><br/><br/><br>
        <big><b>Objective:</b></big><br/> <br>Exercise your memory retention skills by replicating sequences of button presses.<br/><br/> <br>
        <big><b>How to Play:</b></big><br/> <br>
        <b>1. Click the "Start Round" button to begin the round.</b><br/>
        <b>2. When the round starts, a random sequence of button presses will be displayed and played out.</b><br/>
        <b>3. Your task is to replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.</b><br/>
        <b>4. As you progress through the game, the sequence will become longer, making the game more challenging.</b><br/><br/>
        <big><b>Scoring:</b></big><br/> <br>
        Your score is based on your accuracy rate, which is the percentage of correctly replicated sequences compared to the total sequences played.<br/> <br>
        High scores are determined as follows:<br/> <br>
        If your accuracy rate is between 60% and 69%, your high score is 1.<br/> <br>
        If your accuracy rate is between 70% and 79%, your high score is 2.<br/> <br>
        If your accuracy rate is between 80% and 99%, your high score is 3.<br/> <br>
        If your accuracy rate is 100%, your high score is 5.<br/> <br>
        Otherwise, your high score is 0.<br/><br/> <br>
        <big><b>Statistics:</b></big><br/>
        Your average round time is recorded as you play through the game, providing insight into your performance.<br/><br/>
        <big>Get ready to challenge your memory and aim for the high score!</big>
